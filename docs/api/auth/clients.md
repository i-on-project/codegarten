# Clients

A client is an entity that is authorized to use the API. This entity is allowed to create new users.

## Registering a client
Currently, clients can only be registered manually in the database. In order to register a client, the following information is required:
* Name - The client's name
* Secret - A secret to be used in the OAuth protocol when obtaining a user's access token
* Redirect URI - Location to send the auth code in the OAuth protocol 

A client ID is also needed but it's auto generated by the DBMS.
