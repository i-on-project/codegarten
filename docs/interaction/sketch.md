## Protecting Classroom Invites

#### How to associate a CodeGarten account with a Student ID from a given Institution
- The student inserts his student ID and will receive a verification link on his institutional e-mail, which will take him back to CodeGarten, verifying the ownership of the institutional e-mail

#### How do Classroom Invites work
- Teacher generates an invite link for the classroom
- Students, via that link, will have to log in with their CodeGarten account (create one if it doesn't exist), and link their institutional e-mail with their CodeGarten account if needed (process described above)

#### Institutions:
- Have a name and a unique ID
- Have a way to associate a student number to a student e-mail (for instance, type an email with a {id} where the number would be placed)
- Used when inviting students
- Exclusive to the logged in user? Shared with everyone?
